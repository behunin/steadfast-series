A very incomplete overview of useful information to get started with Switch development. Please add anything that's missing :)

### Switch Hardware/Software

- [ReSwitched](https://discord.com/invite/ZdqEhed) an excellent resource and community for Switch homebrew and hacking.
- [SwitchBrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is probably the best resource for the Switch hardware/software internals.
- [ARMv8-A Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/latest/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile) describes Switch's CPU architecture.
